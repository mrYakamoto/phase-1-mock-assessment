# Teenage Slang Translator

Ignore bonus.md for now -- that's a bonus release for when/if you've finished the core challenges.

## Release 0

Studies show that 105% of teenagers evade adults by communicating in slang. Help parents out by making a dictionary for teen slang.

(No need to make a class -- this is just a basic data structure and a method.)

Make the driver code in translator.rb pass.

## Release 1

Update your translator.rb file to accept a phrase on the command line.

(You can comment out the driver code if it's annoying you.)

For instance:

    ruby translator.rb "Got an A on my test"

should print "Got asked to prom by a dreamy Ruby-programming senior" to the screen.
