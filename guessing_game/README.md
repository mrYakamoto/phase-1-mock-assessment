# Guessing Game

Ignore bonus.md for now -- that's a bonus release for when/if you've finished the core challenges.

## Release 0

Make all of the driver code in driver_code_release_0.rb evaluate to true. Running

    ruby driver_code_release_0.rb

should result in a bunch of "true"s printing to the screen.

(Right now, it fails when it tries to run -- that's normal, since you haven't written anything yet!)

Tip: This is driver code, not RSpec -- you must solve the tests in order, because each line of driver code depends on the lines above it running correctly.

*Don't forget to commit!*

## Release 1

Make all of the driver code in driver_code_release_1.rb evaluate to true.

Note: This will break Release 0. That's okay, but commit before you start.

*Don't forget to commit when you finish Release 1! From here on out, it's up to you to remember.*
