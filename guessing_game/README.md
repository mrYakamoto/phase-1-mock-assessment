# Guessing Game

## Release 0

Make all of the driver code in driver_code_release_0.rb evaluate to true. Running "ruby driver_code_release_0.rb" should result in a bunch of "true"s printing to the screen.

(Right now, it fails when it tries to run -- that's normal.)

Tip: This is driver code, not RSpec -- you must solve the tests in order because each line of driver code depends on the lines above it running correctly.

## Release 1

Make all of the driver code in driver_code_release_1.rb evaluate to true.
