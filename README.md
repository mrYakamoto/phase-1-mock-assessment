# Instructions

Please work by yourself. Unless instructed to do so, please do not change the tests.

**Commit after each release (or more often if you like). Do not push your code until the assessment has ended.**

Resources available:
- your notes/code (please avoid copying and pasting your code)
- teachers/TAs
- Google, documentation, etc.
- breaks (take a lap around the floor or a few minutes to breathe, you'll feel better!)
- comments (If you can't quite get it working, comment and tell us what your thought process was)

**Attempt the following challenges in order. You are welcome to move on if you get stuck, but give each section a try.**

Skip the bonus section until you're finished with the main releases.

1. [Translator] (translator)
2. [Guessing Game] (guessing_game)
3. [Refactoring] (refactoring)
